"""
You are given two linked lists representing two positive integers. The lists start with the most significant digit and
each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

Constraints:
- the lists represent numbers without leading zeros
- each list has between 1 and 100 digits
- the value for each digit is 0 through 9

Examples:
- [4,0,4,6] + [2,0,5] => [4,2,5,1]
- [5,6,7] + [0] => [5,6,7]
